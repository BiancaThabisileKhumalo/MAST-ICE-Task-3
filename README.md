#Mystery Number Challenge App

Welcome! This is a simple React Native app built for a fun two-player experience. Players enter their names, hit "Start Game," and jump into a playful 3×3 grid where each cell alternates between "X" and "O". It's basic, clean, and styled with a calming blue theme.

Home Screen: Enter player names and start the game.
Game Screen: See both names and play on a 3×3 grid.
Styling: Clean layout using React Native’s `StyleSheet.create()` with shades of blue.
Navigation: Smooth transitions between screens using React Navigation.
